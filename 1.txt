     Hey dairy,

so my day started on 6.20 in the morning..i woke up by the sound of an alram clock..acutally alarm was not able to wake me up before 6.20 as yesterday night i slept around 2 am..now  a days what is happening to me i am ot able to understand it..bcoz everyday when i am wakin i am thinking that i will bunk my class..but now a days in Spring mcv the most important topic is going on.. i know if i would bunk one class i should definitely pay a lot..ok so far i went to coaching..In morning small rain was there and i forgot to take my umbrella..so without umbrella i had gone to my coaching..
yesterday night i was so mch tensed about my Laptop..so after came back from coaching i gave my laptop to mani bhais roomate for repairing..then he opened the laptop and told me the bios chip and processor is completely gone.and my processor is inbuilt in the motherBoard so he said that i have to buy a new motherboard for the laptop..i was tensed like anything,,jyoti calmed me down but still i was not able to calm as that bros said for replacing the mother board it would take Rs 12000.00...i think 12000 mean it is huge and i dont have that much amount now..mummy also tried to calm me down through call..Then i slept for 3hours..when i woke up it was around 6pm..Then i called aurobinda bhai..He explained me  a lot and one which made me happy was:->"Dont be so much worry on small small things ,,i am always with you"that word my day..Then jyoti ganesh and me went for some tiffin..and also at 12am we ate chicken...

so it was definitely a memorable day..
