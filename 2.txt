Hey diary,,
       Actually u know yesterday i said you that now a days i am always thinking i should bunk my morning classes so that thing happened today..mean  i bunk my todays class..i woke up late aftre that i called to Hp care and went with jyoti..it was in my mind that a huge problem is there ..somehow when i got call from HP care that only bios chip was damaged and current is not passing throuhgh that bios chip,i had to repair that part only.. i was bit happy..i got calmed down then told to jyoti to go there..only 2000rs they took..so i brought some biriyani and had dinner together..
      
Then after in night aurobinda bhai made a call and told i life lots of situation may come where you have to pay some extra rupees, no doubt on it that in everyones life it will come,,u have to tackle it..if some manufacturing defect or internal problem is there with you then try to come out of it..and do excercise for your problem..
   thats absolutely true,,i completely agree..

Actually today morning he requested me to say NO on one thing ,,the thing was he wants to give me a REDMI NOTE 7..and as usual my mind say that he should not give..so on that point in night conversation he told me if i would have an elder sonof your parents then you would have the responsibiloties of mine..just think like that..All door has closed after listening those words..His decession is the final decession and i know he will give it..But omehow i am damn happy

  and I hink am definitely a gifetd child ..so i am happy today

 BY BYYY ..Love love..
