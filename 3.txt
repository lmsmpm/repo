hey ,whatsup!!
so today actually the day for brothers nd the day for soldiers ri8..i mean its the day of independence and also day of Raksha bandhan..yesterday ni8 i talked with auro bhai he said to buy rakhi and celebrate with own..but i denied..
so the day started with rosy nana's call..i got angry when she told  do u tie rakhi or not? as she had  not sent the rakhi also..it was a pretty sadden day as no one wished me happy raksha bandhan also in my family group...that was  the reason of grief also..i just thought that first become something in the life then everyone will call, every sister will come and will want to tie rakhi..as long as you are not earning or not have any social status you dont have any rights to get social respect..
    Now days  am observing rosynana complaining a lot..yaa she is adjusting with the situation but still am thinking some extend she has to adjust more in life ..always am thinking  in future if my wife will become this much complaint about me then what will i do..as am not like subrat bhai,,also am not that much cool and patienceful person..so i cant adjust..afternoon some issues related to rakhi happend..i mean i told to rosynana if u are not able to go to Bhubaneswar then u just call mami and wish rakhaa bandhan to gugu and chuchu..in that word she cried and did lots of hungama  ..in some extend
I tried to make her calm  but she has not able to calm...

so this was the day..yaa it was cool..some experience got..and waiting for the next rakhi let see what will happen...
