Hey dear
As i have been diagnosed with dengue doctor has told to take complete rest for next one month so am in my hometown ,puri..Last one month mean november was completely disaster for me.. I think moving to Bengaluru without proper planning was the worst decession which i have taken in my life..Anyhow i went and tried to settle there..suddenly i was sick and came to know I am suffering from dengue..By god grace Mamu was there and he had taken care of everything..Mummy and baba went there and taken me to puri..Aurobinda bhy,Muna mamu helped a lot..so I must be very much obliged to them..

   You know when i was in Hyderabad everyday i was thinking like if I would be in puri then i would do this thing or i would eat something special like many things was coming to my mind but when i am in the place where everything is there i can eat i can travel i can enjoy but still i am not in a happy mood and the reason is not that much great..One of the reason is all my friend get job but i still not in that position that is one of the reason of my grief and somehow i am managing because everyone has its own time
